  - other calculated _non-numeric_
- Measures - metrics or numbers that can be analyzed; green pills
  - dependent variable
  - numbers, often continuous
  - calculated numeric fields
- Question: why do numbers show up in dimensions part of data window?
  - Answer: sometimes it makes more sense to use a number (month number) as a dimensions
- Discrete vs. continuous
  - Blue pills are discrete, green pills are continuous
  - Use discrete fields for headers - these can be sorted
  - Use continuous fields for axes
  - Show example with updates
- Attributes

#### Data types

### Structuring data
- Tableau is row-wise oriented; expects data in long format (not wide)
- 

### Loading Data
#### Exercise with data interpreter
- pivoting data with Structuring_Data_Exercises:ColumnOriented
- Tasks
  - Load data and review columns
  - Inspect the data interpreter and use
  - Rename the target columns
  - Pivot targets to rows using the pivot option
